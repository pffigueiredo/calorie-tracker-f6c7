    // 2. Check if there are any food log entries referencing this food item
    // 3. Either prevent deletion (with error) or cascade delete log entries based on business rules
    // 4. Delete the food item record from the database
    // 5. Return success status
    // 6. Throw error if food item not found or user doesn't have permission
